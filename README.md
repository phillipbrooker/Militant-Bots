# Militant-Bots
This repo contains code templates referred to in Brooker (2019) "My Unexpectedly Militant Bots: A Case for Programming-as-Social-Science" (published in The Sociological Review).

The code is a little trashy in places, but it works/worked :-) In any case, these templates are purely for reference for people reading the aforementioned paper, and they're readable enough for that purpose.

Documentation is at:
